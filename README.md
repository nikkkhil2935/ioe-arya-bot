# Smart Parking Dashboard ðŸš—

A machine learning-powered parking occupancy and vehicle type prediction system built with Streamlit and XGBoost.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Vacancy Prediction**: Predicts whether a parking slot is vacant or occupied based on temporal features
- ðŸš™ **Vehicle Type Detection**: Classifies vehicles as Two-Wheeler or Four-Wheeler
- ðŸ“Š **Interactive Dashboard**: User-friendly Streamlit interface for real-time predictions
- ðŸ¤– **ML Models**: XGBoost classifiers trained on parking data with engineered features

## Live Demo

## Installation

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikkkhil2935/ioe-arya-bot.git
cd ioe-arya-bot
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Deployment to Streamlit Cloud

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
3. Sign in with GitHub
4. Click "New app"
5. Select your repository: `nikkkhil2935/ioe-arya-bot`
6. Set main file path: `dashboard.py`
7. Click "Deploy"

## Retraining Models

To retrain the models with fresh data:

```bash
python retrain_models.py
```

This will:
1. Load preprocessed parking data
2. Create vacancy labels based on temporal patterns
3. Train both XGBoost models
4. Save updated model files
